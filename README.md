How often do you type a Google search into your address bar, just to click the link that you know will be the first result? With just a keyworded search engine, you can skip directly there!

This OpenSearch XML is for a [Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-im-feeling-lucky/), as search engines can only be added via add-on in Firefox.

Note: This uses ```https://www.google.com/webhp?#q={searchTerms}&amp;btnI=I``` as the auto-redirect I'm Feeling Lucky link. Because of Google black magic, some versions of this link only work for some people, while other versions only work for others. If this link does not work for you, another link probably will. (e.g. ```https://www.google.com/search?btnI=I&q={searchTerms}```)
